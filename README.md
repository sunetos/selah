## Cellara: a game of cells

In Cellara, you manage the health of your cells to try and live a full and happy
life. Cells have DNA that mutates as they clone, slowly increasing the risk of
various diseases. Try to make it 75 years before getting too many diseases!

## Background

I was diagnosed with leukemia (T-AML) at the end of October, so I decided to
spend my hospital free time in November making a game about cell health and
cloning for the 2012 github game-off.

It turned out to be a great project to fill my time, and I really enjoyed using
some new tools like Typescript. I would definitely use Typescript again for
another browser game.
